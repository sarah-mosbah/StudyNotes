# Recursion

--> it's important to understand that recursion take more memory 'stack' in computer than while loops because of many function calls happens in it! it may cause stackoverflow! but it's a bit cleaner.

--> never forget to tell recursive call when to stop.

the base
case, and the recursive case. The recursive case is when the function calls
itself. The base case is when the function doesn’t call itself again

every recursive function has two parts: the base
case, and the recursive case. The recursive case is when the function calls
itself. The base case is when the function doesn’t call itself again ... so it
doesn’t go into an infinite loop.
