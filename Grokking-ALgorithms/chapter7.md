## Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm


- Taking weighted graph into consideration, means not necessary the best path is the path with the minimum segments, we've to take into consideration for instance the length of the segment



- Find the cheapest node. You're at the start
It takes 6 minutes to get to node A and 2 minutes to get to node B. You set other nodes to infinity

- Node B is the cheapest from node B check cheapest node from its neighbours
