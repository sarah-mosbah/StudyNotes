## Hash Tables

- O(1) operation
- let say we've array of grocery items accompained with their prices like this [{egg: 1$}, {milk: 4$}], but even if keys is sorted you'll have to find elements in O(log n) `binary search`
that's where hash functions arised.


### Hash Functions
- A hash function is a function where you put in a string 1 and you get
back a number.
