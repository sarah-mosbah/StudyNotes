## Divide And Conquer:
To solve a problem using D&C, there are two steps:
1. Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
2. Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.


## Quick Sort:
- Array of one element or no length at all is the base case.

- the quicksort base case already
knows how to sort arrays of two elements (the left sub-array) and
empty arrays (the right sub-array);

```
   if (!arr.length) return arr;

   let pivot= arr.shift();
   let left= arr.filter((x)=>x< pivot);
   let right= arr.filter((y)=>y> pivot);

   return [...quickSort(left), pivot, ...quickSort(right)];
```

- the average
case, quicksort takes O(n log n) time, worst case O(n^2), and it depends on the pivot you choose.

- Quicksort has a smaller constant than
merge sort. So if theyâ€™re both O(n log n) time, quicksort is faster. And
quicksort is faster in practice because it hits the average case way more
often than the worst case.

- Quick sort is O (n log(n)) because down the stack you touch every element --> each level take o(n) `left and right`
log n in partitioning `hight of call stack is log n`  --> o(n log(n))
